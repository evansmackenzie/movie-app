# # This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# # The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# # Examples:
# #
# #   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
# #   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# # actor = Actor.new(first_name: "Nathan", last_name: "Fillion", known_for: "Firefly")
# # actor.save

# # actor = Actor.create(first_name: "Jack", last_name: "Nickolson", known_for: "The Shining")

# # actor = Actor.create(first_name: "Kurt", last_name: "Russel", known_for: "The Thing")

# actor = Actor.create({first_name: "Benedict", last_name: "Cumberbatch", known_for: "Sherlock"})

# actor = Actor.create({first_name: "Christopher", last_name: "Lee", known_for: "The Lord of the Rings"})
